		Tips for today: <br>
		<b> Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates </b>
<br>
<i> Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.
<br>
Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.
<br>
They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.
<br>
Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.
<br>
Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what increases the calorie content â€“ for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta </i>
